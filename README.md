# Wormhole Extreme

![Wormhole-Extreme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainner/wormhole-extreme/master/thumb.jpg)

This is an experimental interactive space scene rendered on the browser using WebGL and Three.js with Javascript. The 3D scene contains planets, stars and a nebula effect that changes color and warps into a "wormhole" effect to create the illusion of traveling through space.

##### [Check out the demo][demo]

### Build Tasks

Comes with Gulp and Browser-sync configured, just run these to get started:

```javascript
// get the dependencies installed
$ npm install

// start dev server and watch for changes
$ gulp initScene
```

Build output (JS/CSS) can be found in the /dist folder.
